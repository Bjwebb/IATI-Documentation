Description
-----------

The activity standard is designed for reporting the details of individual aid activities. An activity is defined by the reporting organisation â€“ depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.

The activity standard is the most widely used part of IATI. A reporting organisation will typically produce one IATI activity file per country or geographical region.

The standard supports around forty different fields, referenced by standard code lists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.
