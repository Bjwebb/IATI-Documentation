Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the location being used can be declared as such:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name>Ivory Coast</name>

It is also good practice to declare this name in the language of the
country where the project is being implemented, particularly if this
differs from the default language of the activity:

.. code-block:: xml

    <name xml:lang-"fr">CÃ´te d'Ivoire</name>
