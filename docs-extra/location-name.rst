Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name of the location being used can be declared as such:

``
<name>Ivory Coast</name>
`` It is also good practice to declare this name in the language of the
country where the project is being implemented, particularly if this
differs from the default language of the activity:

``
<name xml:lang-"fr">CÃ´te d'Ivoire</name>
``
